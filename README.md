Dynamic Form Builder
This is a dynamic, user-friendly form builder built with React and Redux. It allows users to create and configure custom forms with various field types, set advanced validation rules, and preview how the form will look and behave in real-time. All form configurations are saved and managed in the browser's local storage.

Customizable Fields: Configure each field with a label, required toggle, and default value.

Advanced Validation: Set rules for minimum/maximum length, email format, and a custom password rule.

Live Preview: View how the form will appear to end-users in a live-updating modal.

Form Persistence: All form schemas are saved and retrieved from localStorage, so your forms are always available.

Clean UI/UX: The application features a modern, responsive design with smooth animations.
