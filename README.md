üìù Dynamic Form Builder
This is a dynamic, user-friendly form builder built with React and Redux. It allows users to create and configure custom forms with various field types, set advanced validation rules, and preview how the form will look and behave in real-time. All form configurations are saved and managed in the browser's localStorage.
